                    The purpose of this site is to tell more about
                    myself. I am currently a student in the Amazon
                    Correlation One Software Development program. My mission is
                    to become proficient in software devolpment. I am
                    still exploring what routine I want to pursue in this
                    field but I am confident that I will have a better idea
                    by the end of this course.

                <p class="solid">
                    My name is Latoya Alexander and I live in Atlanta, GA.
                    I love dancing and baking cakes. I am currently an
                    Amazon employee but, for the past 15 years I worked
                    as a Patient Access Specialist for a large healthcare
                    organiztion in Atlanta. I felt that is was time for a career
                    change which led me to the Amazon Correlation One Software
                    Development program.

                    So far in my web developer program I have learned
